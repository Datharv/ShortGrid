# ShortGrid
requirements :- pygame == 2.3.0

Developed a Python project utilizing the Pygame library to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm, a widely used pathfinding algorithm. The project focused on solving the shortest path problem in a grid-based environment.

Key Features:

-> Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a 2D grid.

-> Utilized Pygame for creating an interactive and visually engaging environment to display the grid and pathfinding process.

-> Enabled users to set start and target points, as well as place obstacles on the grid to simulate real-world scenarios.

-> Incorporated interactive controls for users to initiate the algorithm's execution and observe the step-by-step pathfinding process.

-> Visualized the algorithm's progress through animations, highlighting explored nodes and the shortest path discovered.

-> Ensured optimal performance and responsiveness in the visualization to enhance the user experience.

-> Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, algorithmic understanding, and proficiency in Python programming.

-> Gained valuable insights into data structures and algorithms, as well as the practical application of pathfinding techniques

Overall, the project showcased my ability to combine Python programming with Pygame to create an interactive and visually informative visualization of Dijkstra's -algorithm, demonstrating both technical proficiency and creativity in solving real-world problems.
